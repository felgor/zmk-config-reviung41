ZMK-Reviung5 Project - 14/12/2022

A personal project to add ZMK via nice!nano to a Reviung5 for a bluetooth media remote. 
Currently stable with left side encoder, functioning RGB underglow andd a layer for BT profile switching and clearing.

Master branch will be the current, stable, working version and the Reviung5 branch will be my current WIP - may or may not be functional.

Please refer to https://zmk.dev/docs/ for keymapping
Only TAB Q W E R are used by the Reviung5 - keymap needs cleaning up.
